## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
<launch> 
 <group ns="/"> 
  <param name="rosversion" command="rosversion roslaunch" /> 
  <param name="rosdistro" command="rosversion -d" /> 
  <node pkg="rosout" type="rosout" name="rosout" respawn="true"/> 
 </group> 
</launch>
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
